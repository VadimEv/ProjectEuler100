First language of choice is Javascript so that anyone can run it in browser's console.

1) Open, for example, Chrome - press ctrl+shift+I (cmd+shift+i on macs), and seclect console tab.
2) copy and paste challenge code.

During challenge 4 it became obvious that interpreting languages like JS, Py is not fit for large
numbers, so second language to be introduced gonna be C/C++
